## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
HTTP stands for Hyper text transfer protocol. It's a protocol to make sure that communications done between clients and servers follow a pattern that is acceptable. It's important because it minimizes the amount of potential problems that may arise as clients talk to servers.
2. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible)
[My Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14picmLeatm0bQnkh6-zH4oREcwtxZDVAwTWuBbvhhrc/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
Every http request has a path and a verb. The path determines where the action will take place. The verb is what that action is. Such as GET for reading information or POST for creating a new resource at that location. 
4. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
HTML is the bones or structure of a website. CSS is how it looks, including colors, backgrounds, and a million other ways to customize websites.
5. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?
You can look at how changes you make affect the look or structure of a website in an environment that wont actually change things allowing you to experiment without having to worry about breaking something.
6. How do you open the chrome dev tools?
F12, right click inspect, or CTRL-SHIFT-I
7. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
It's very important for readability. <DIV></DIV> by itself does nothing for understanding what an element is. <header></header> lets the reader know at a glance that this will be at the top of the page.
8. What are the three components of the box model?
Margin, Border, Padding
